/*
The question promt did not say specifically that the first two arrays needed to be filled
inside of the main function. So to make the code cleaner I only created then inside of the
main function and then passed them into the Fill_Arrs function to be worked on
If I were to have to fill them in the main function I would have simply used the same process
that was used in fill arrs

int length = 20;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < length ; i++)
        
    {
        arr1[i] = rand() % 100 +1;
        arr2[i] = rand() % 100 +1;

and then just have the fill arrs function add the two arrs together as it does in the end
